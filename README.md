This project uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict whether wikipedia articles are about democrats or republicans or third party politicians.

NOTE: This project was inspired by a class I took in 2021 with Prof. Dan Jurafsky; the original motivation, however, came from a paper I read in an English class
taught by Prof. Rebecca Richardson.
