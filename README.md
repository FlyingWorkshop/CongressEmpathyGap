# CongressEmpathyGap
The goal of this project is to visualize a claim put forward by J.D. Trout about an "empathy gap." Trout claims that congressmen's voting records on women's issues can be predicted based on whether they have daughters. This projects attempts to verify and visualize this claim.

NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS!

What's new?
bills.py, votes.py have been deprecated. They are now found in database.py
rattenfanger.py is still under progress. I'm thinking about using a Naive Bayes Classifier to explore the data
